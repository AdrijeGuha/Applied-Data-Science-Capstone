In this capstone, we predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage landed successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company, SpaceY in this hypothetical case, wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

I as a data scientist working for a new rocket company called SpaceY with the help of the data science findings and models in this report, will enable SpaceY to make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
